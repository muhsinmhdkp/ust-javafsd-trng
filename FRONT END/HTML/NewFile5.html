	<p><h4 style="margin-left:362px; margin-right:300px">On August 28, 2021, Jeanette Zacarias Zapata was knocked out in a Montreal boxing ring. Just five days later she died, aged 18. <br><br>
	During the bout, the Mexican boxer had taken a succession of punches to the head with the final hook even knocking out her mouthguard. These strikes are celebrated, but what is it that's being glorified? On the surface, some might say the art of fighting. A look inside the brain, however, reveals an ugly truth.<br><br>
	"You lose consciousness. If it's bad, your brain will start bleeding," world-renowned neurologist Steven Laureys told DW. "Our brains are fragile. They need a lot of energy. There are four big arteries but a lot of very small vessels. If these blood vessels rupture blood in the skull, it compresses the brain and you can die."</h4></p>

  		<p><h4 style="margin-left:362px; margin-right:300px">Boxing by nature targets that "fragile" part of the body, as the brain bears the brunt of the force. "Ten, 20 years later what you see is a shrunken brain, a sick demented brain because of the repeated blows," continued Laureys. "It's the long-term damage that we call punch drunk or pugilistic dementia or now chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)."</h4></h4></p>

	<h4 style="margin-left:362px; margin-right:300px">In simpler terms, <em style="color: blue;">brain disease</em>. There is no cure for it and the damage is so far-reaching that it can even change someone's personality, impacting parts of the brain that are responsible for memory and emotions.<br><br>
	"Your brain cells interact, and they will do so through these bridges. When you take a blow, these connections will literally break. So, you shake it, you break it."<br><br>
	What makes boxing so tricky is that the injuries are not immediately visible. Society would never expect a tennis player to continue playing with a broken arm or a footballer with a broken leg. But boxers are expected to fight the invisible repercussions of<em style="color: blue;"> brain injuries</em>.

	<p><h4 style="margin-left:362px; margin-right:300px">"There are a lot of boxers, young boxers who have CTE without even knowing it because you can't see it," said Laureys. "You need special brain scans to see what's going on inside. The effects are only visible to the boxers themselves 10, 20, 30 years later."</h4></p>
